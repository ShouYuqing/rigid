# Rigid registration for 3D MRI 

Self-developed code for rigid registration under the supervision of [Dr.Sabuncu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pig-I4QAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [A.Dalca](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zRy-zdAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

The code is currently in development.

## Spatial Transformer

A 3D-spatial transformer, which is similar to the standard STN is utilized to do the registration task.

Trying to solve an optimization problem, which will get an affine transform matrix for spatial transformer to do the registration.
