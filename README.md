# Rigid registration for 3D MRI 

[comment]: <Self-developed code for rigid registration during the research with [Dr.Sabuncu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pig-I4QAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [A.Dalca](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zRy-zdAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). >

The code is currently in development.

## Data Augmentation
Rotate 3D image: /ext/image 

## 3D-UNet

A 3D-UNet featured with unsampling and dowsampling layer is used to learn the shift flow between two different images.

CNN outputs three 3D flows.

## Spatial Transformer

A 3D-spatial transformer, which is similar to the standard STN is utilized to do the registration task.

Trying to solve an optimization problem, which will get an affine transform matrix for spatial transformer to do the registration.
